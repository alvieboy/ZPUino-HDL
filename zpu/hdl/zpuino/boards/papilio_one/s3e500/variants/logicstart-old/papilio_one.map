Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,999 out of   4,656   64%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,999 out of   2,999 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,999   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,297 out of   9,312   46%
